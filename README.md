# Stock Globetrotter

## Description
This application is a quick calculator to determine a stock's value through a currency conversion to a user's chosen currency. It implements the Yahoo Finance API as well as the ExchangeRate-api to calculate a stock's local value. We are currently only using 3 stocks and 3 currency exchanges to hit our MVP, but plan to expand on this, using a search function, to allow a user to search any stock option as well as any currency.

## User Story
AS AN Investor who travels  
I WANT to keep track of my stock's exchange rate for where I am  
SO I know my stock's value in relation to my location.  

## Application Link and Usage
The application can be reached at https://evan-hatley.github.io/StockGlobetrotter/ . To use the app, simply load the page and select your stock and currency. 

## Technologies Used
The two APIs we will use in this project are the Yahoo Finance API (https://financeapi.net/) and ExchangeRates (https://exchangeratesapi.io/). We also used Materialize for CSS/HTML and jquery for our Javascript.
